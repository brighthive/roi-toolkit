1149,RN to Bachelor of Science in Nursing Completion,"","","",51.3817,"Adding a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) to your credentials could help push your nursing career further ahead. Regis University can help put you on your way to a richer, fuller experience in a short amount of time with the RN to BSN program.       We’re giving credit where credit is due! The Loretto Heights School of Nursing has approved a credit transfer policy aimed to ensure RNs with an associate’s degree are given the maximum amount of credit possible. Here’s how it works - if you graduated from a regionally accredited institution, completed an ADN program requiring a minimum of 66 semester hours, and have a current license, you’re eligible for a lump sum transfer of at least 66 semester hours. If your ADN program consisted of more than 66 semester hours, additional credit may be awarded. This equates to fewer non-nursing courses, saving you even more time and money! Various core studies courses are not included in the block transfer policy. These courses include:     3 SH of philosophy  6 SH of religious studies   3 SH of statistics   6 SH of lower division electives   6 SH of upper division electives   If you’ve already completed any of these courses, we’ll review for transfer credit on a course-by-course basis. Applicants with an Associate’s Degree in Nursing from a non-regionally accredited school, from programs that required less than 66 semester hours, and from diploma RN programs will be awarded 33 hours for RN licensure as guided by the Colorado Articulation Model. All previously completed non-nursing courses will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis.    DEGREE EARNED  Graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) expanding leadership and promotion opportunities.  FORMAT  ONLINE OPTION  Flexible format allows you to log in anytime, day or night as you complete weekly assignments. Each class lasts eight weeks allowing you to progress quickly. No campus visits are required for online students, but we encourage you to celebrate your graduation in person!    CAMPUS BLENDED OPTION    Our hybrid campus program blends classroom and online courses, which allows you great convenience, but also personal contact and guidance.  Classes typically meet one time per week but can vary by course.    LENGTH OF PROGRAM  The required RN to BSN curriculum can be completed in approximately 18 - 24 months, depending on the pace at which you choose to take courses, and the number of core courses a student needs to complete. Courses are taught in 8 week terms.   START DATES  The Online format begins three times a year, August, January and May.  The campus based hybrid format begins one time a year, August.   ACCREDITATION  Regis University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

938,HBI PACT for Active Duty Service Members,"","","",46.0,"HBI will advance the successful reintegration of Fort Carson separating soldiers into the civilian workforce by preparing them for entry into, and success within, the building industry. Program participants will (i) receive industry trades training; (ii) earn portable, industry-recognized credentials; and (iii) be placed in employment in the building industry or (in a minority of cases) post-secondary education upon separation from the military. The population served will be Fort Carson non-officer (primarily), separating soldiers within 180 days from discharge. Fort Carson programming will be modeled on HBI’s current Fort Stewart, Georgia programming where our placement rate was 94% in the first year of operation.    Training  Training will take place five days a week, from 8:00AM to 4:30PM (or a similar time-frame agreed to with Fort Carson Garrison Command). Student to teacher ratios do not exceed 12:1. Students typically complete programming within 12-14 weeks.     Training will be done using HBI’s Pre-Apprenticeship Certificate Training (PACT) curriculum. PACT is one of three pre-apprenticeship curricula approved by the U.S. Department of Labor and integrates residential green building standards approved by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and the American National Standard Institute. The PACT curriculum will expose Fort Carson separating soldiers to a variety of trades, such as carpentry, electrical, plumbing, masonry and HVAC. PACT is vetted every 2 years by subject matter experts to ensure student training is up to date with industry trends and best practices.  Successful students will also earn an OSHA credential issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.       Following the apprenticeship model, 70-80% of PACT instruction is devoted to hands-on, work-based learning. The Fort Carson program location will be equipped with a variety of training stations to perform labs corresponding to different trade areas. In addition to labs, the hands-on learning component includes performance of a community service project. At Fort Stewart, for example, students participated in the construction of a “Tiny House” for the Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless, which was used as a prototype home to provide housing to homeless veterans in the Savannah, Georgia area. Texts, workbooks, hard hats, safety glasses and shoes are provided to all students. Successful graduates will be provided a set of hand tools to be used in their placed employment.    Placement  Over the course of programming, soldiers will have developed individual training and employment plans, which provide a checklist of practical accomplishments leading to full employability in the industry. The program manager will work with HBI regional placement coordinators and tap into HBI’s Colorado and national networks for job leads. HBI’s continued relationship with NAHB, the largest trade association representing the housing industry, provides HBI with access to over 700 state and local home builders associations (HBAs) across the country. Together these HBAs represent over 40,000 members of the building industry, many of whom provide employment opportunities for our graduates. Whether a soldier remains in Colorado Springs or relocates to Denver upon discharge, that individual will be placed in employment. Resume customization, mock interviews, and assistance with scheduling interviews are additional functions performed by the program manager.     Follow-up is maintained on a weekly basis through the first 2-months of employment. Thereafter, individuals will be contacted once a month for the next 4 months. Graduates who have discharged from the military and not found employment will have weekly meetings with the program manager until they have secured employment.",4635,75,1,"",,,400,400,407,810,1,5,7804

Electronic health records (EHRs), provider order entry systems and diagnostic technologies are just a few of the IT solutions being implemented by today’s health care industry. In addition to the demands of the electronic health record systems, other applications are being deployed that require health professionals who understand both technology and the management of information.  Electronic information plays a critical role in reducing medical errors and decreasing costs, ultimately leading to happier, healthier patients.           The demands to develop and maintain our country’s health data systems are rapidly increasing. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, there will be a 15 percent growth in the number of health information management jobs through 2024.      It takes trained, experienced professionals to ensure that health care systems deliver timely and accurate information in the correct format while meeting regulatory requirements.     Is a Master’s degree in Health Care Informatics & Information Management for me?     Health care informatics and information management professionals understand technology and its role in promoting the effective organization, management and use of information within the health care environment and also work to bridge the gap between clinicians and technical employees.     People who pursue HIIM careers have strong analytical and technical skills, coupled with communication skills to work alongside other professionals. Perhaps above all else, an ethical mindset and the ability to keep patient data confidential is essential to uphold the integrity of the profession.      If you’re a member of the military or you’ve returned from military service, Regis also has great tuition options to help you build on the skills you learned during your service.     What will I learn in Regis’ Master of Science in Health Care Informatics and Information Management program?     Our M.S. in Health Care Informatics and Information Management program is designed for current health care professionals looking to expand your knowledge of systems planning and implementation, workflow design, security management and electronic health information management. Beyond IT, the program also includes project management, leadership development and ethics all taught from a health care perspective.         Unlike other programs, our master’s degree prepares you with knowledge of both health informatics and health information management. What’s the difference? Informatics is focused on designing, developing and maintaining systems and processes, while information management is focused on maintaining, organizing, and securing patient data.",22860,500,2,http://www.regis.edu/CCIS/Academics/Degrees-Programs/Graduate-Programs/Health-Care-Informatics-and-Information-Management.aspx,,,36,0,447,851,1,5,7742

1175,Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing,25-1199.00,27-3041.00,27-3043.05,23.1302,"Welcome to the Mile-High MFA!    Our unique focus combines a thorough instruction in the craft and business of writing with the practical application of our students’ abilities as writers in the world. In addition to the expert guidance they receive as they progress from original drafts to final manuscript, students will graduate the program fully prepared to embark on a writing career, bolstered and invigorated by the support of their new writing community.    The Mile-High MFA is not for casual writers who see writing as a hobby. It is for writers who are ready to take themselves seriously and fully engage in writing as a vocation.    DISTINCT FEATURES    the lowest (5 to 1) average student-faculty ratio in the country  the only MFA program in the Mile-High City  one of only two Jesuit low-residency MFA programs in the country—and “Jesuit” stands for academic rigor and cura personalis (care for the whole person)  one of the only three low-residency programs that require students to use their writing talents to contribute to their community, and the only one requiring a “Writing in the World” Action Plan  the only program that offers a “ski day” during the January residency and a “whitewater adventure” during the July residency  DEGREE OVERVIEW      The Mile-High MFA requires the successful completion of four 16-week writing semesters and five nine-day residencies. Students will begin with an Orientation at their first residency and end with a Commencement ceremony in their final residency. Following each residency (except the last) will be a semester-long study in which students will work one-on-one with a faculty mentor. By their final residency, students will have written and revised 240-400 pages of prose (fiction, nonfiction, graphic novel, writing for performance) or 160-240 pages of poetry/flash fiction, along with at least 40 book annotations, at least four critical responses, an annotated bibliography, a book-length thesis, a critical introduction to their thesis, a Critical Essay in their major genre, and a Writing in the World Action Plan.    GENRE STUDY     Students typically choose one genre to study, in which case they participate in five residency workshops and study for four semesters in the same genre. Such students also have the option of taking one residency workshop and one semester in a different genre (i.e. three semesters in their main genre plus one semester in any other genre). Students may also choose to apply (by the end of their second residency at the latest) for a Dual-Genre Study, which entails an additional semester (for a total of five) and an additional residency (for a total of six). A dual-genre student will take three residency workshops and three semesters in their main genre (i.e. the genre in which they will write their MFA thesis) and two residency workshops and two semesters in their secondary genre.     GENRES               Choose among the following:    POETRY (traditional or experimental)  FICTION (literary, young-adult, speculative; fiction students may also choose to specialize in editing)  NONFICTION (creative/narrative/literary—i.e. personal essays or memoir; nonfiction students may also choose to specialize in research-based narratives, e.g. writing about the lives of other people)  WRITING FOR PERFORMANCE (plays, one-person shows, experimental drama, community-based)  GRAPHIC NOVEL (fiction, or nonfiction)  LOW-RESIDENCY FORMAT    The low-residency format offers the flexibility of working from home without sacrificing academic rigor. Indeed the low-residency format may be said to be more rigorous than a traditional (residential) MFA program, since instead of attending workshops once a week and having one of their pieces workshopped every four weeks, low-residency students are working intensely on their writing for 20-25 hours per week and receiving one-on-one feedback from their faculty mentor every four weeks on a greater volume of their work.  Here’s how it works: students will come to the Regis University campus in Denver twice a year, in January and July, for nine-day residencies (out-of-town students will stay in a local hotel in January, and either on campus or in a hotel in July), where they will attend workshops, craft lessons, writers’ chats, and readings, and meet with their faculty mentors to form a study plan for the succeeding semester. They will then return home to work one-on-one (corresponding electronically) with that faculty mentor for 16 weeks.  Students will be assigned mentors for their first semester. Following the first semester, students will have the option of requesting mentors in their genre, choosing from the list below. Student/mentor assignments will be made according to student preferences and mentor availability.     ACCESSIBLE, ENGAGING FACULTY     Whereas in a traditional program students may attend class one to three times a week and rarely see their professors outside of class, in a low-residency program they will see all faculty members throughout the residency and find it easy to establish strong relationships with them, as well as with their fellow students. The accessibility of the faculty and directors, and the spirit de corps among all members of the MFA community, are what makes the low-residency degree so appealing---and this is especially true of the Mile-High MFA, where our faculty and directors make every effort to avail themselves to students and where we do all we can to create opportunities for students to collaborate with and support one another.  WRITING IN THE WORLD     MFA students will attend seminars on the real-life applications of writing and (by their final residency at the latest) submit a Writing in the World Action Plan in which they describe how they will use their writing talents to contribute to their communities, either in a professional capacity or through community outreach. (Examples include running a writing workshop at a local prison or library, writing for a nonprofit, organizing a reading series, or running an after-school “Teen Writers” workshop.)     CRITICAL ESSAY      At any point before Semester IV, MFA students must submit an essay (15-20 pages) on a topic in their genre—the study of a particular craft element (for example, the use of setting) in books they’ve studied in their Writing Semesters; the utility (or lack thereof) of writing groups; current publishing trends; a detailed analysis of canonical works, etc. The best of these will be selected as a feature of the MFA graduation ceremony.    MFA ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY      The MFA Annotated Bibliography is a list of books read during the student’s two years of study in the MFA program. These works will include those assigned to them by their faculty mentors and those they read on their own. The annotated bibliography, when completed, will contain over forty books (eight assigned per semester plus the books students read on their own). Annotations should be arranged in alphabetical order by authors’ last names.    MFA THESIS     The MFA Thesis, a book-length manuscript (150-250 pages of fiction, creative nonfiction, YA fiction or graphic novel, 90-120 pages of writing for performance, or 50-80 pages of poetry or flash fiction) written, revised, and approved by the fourth-semester faculty mentor who serves as the student’s thesis advisor, is the culmination of the student’s work during the four residencies and four semesters of the Mile-High MFA program. This manuscript should be a significant and distinctly original work of art. It will be accompanied by a preface in which the author places the book in context of the learning that has taken place over the program. In a way, the MFA thesis is not only a book-length manuscript but also a final exam of sorts, in that faculty advisors, fellow students, and program directors should be able to see evidence of a mastery of the writing instruction instilled in the student for the past two years.    RESIDENCIES     Twice a year, in January and July, students will attend nine-day residencies, from Friday evening to the following Sunday afternoon, with an “Intermezzo” on Wednesdays. Residencies are inspiring, invigorating gatherings of like-minded writers that provide students with the opportunity to learn their craft, workshop their writing, attend readings by award-winning writers, and immerse themselves in the writing life. Our brilliant yet down-to-earth faculty mentors will eat, drink, and converse with students, providing lessons and advice on writing and the publishing world.    Toward the end of each residency students will meet (either in person or via Skype) with the faculty mentor they will be working with during the succeeding semester and (together with their mentor) develop a study plan, including a list of eight books that will constitute their Semester Reading List, along with at least two other books students decide to read on their own. In addition, students will write Critical Responses to any two books on their Reading List, except during Semester III, when they are composing their Critical Essay, and Semester IV, when they are completing their MFA Thesis.    A month prior to every residency, students will submit a sample of their work (3500-7500 words of double-spaced prose (fiction, narrative nonfiction, YA fiction, or writing for performance), and 10-15 pages of poetry or flash fiction, that will be distributed to the other students in their workshop. Thus it is required of all students that they communicate with their workshop instructors and program coordinator before each residency via their Regis email account.    Out-of-town students will work with the program coordinator to arrange for housing in a hotel or on-campus residence hall.     WRITING SEMESTERS     Each semester’s writing plan and reading list will have been developed by students in dialogue with their faculty mentors during the preceding residency. Students should expect to devote about 20-25 hours a week to this endeavor, submitting four packets of original writing (one packet per month), ten annotations (2-3 per packet) on both canonical and contemporary books in their genre, and critical responses to any two books (per semester) on their reading list (except during their penultimate semester, when they compose their Critical Essay, and their final semester, when they complete their MFA Thesis). Any additional (optional) books the student reads during the semester should also be reviewed and listed in the student’s MFA Annotated Bibliography.  Faculty will have the option of using online classroom sites (Desire2Learn/WorldClass) to conduct conversations with students, receive submissions (through Dropbox), and allow for students to discuss, among themselves, their reading or writing. At their Study Plan meeting during the residency, each faculty mentor will specify his or her preferred method of receiving submissions and providing feedback. Faculty are responsible for using the provided syllabus templates to ensure that students complete their required work for their course section (for example, drafts of the Critical Essay and their Writing in the World plan).  SAMPLE PROGRAM SCHEDULE     Students accepted to the Mile-High MFA may begin their studies in either January or July. (Typically, January residencies will be scheduled for the first full week of the month; July residencies will take place during the third or final week of that month).     The following is a sample schedule for the students beginning in January:    YEAR 1  January	Residency I  January-May	Writing Semester I  July	Residency II  August-December	Writing Semester IIYEAR 2  January	Residency II  January-May	Writing Semester III  July	Residency IV  August-December	Writing Semester IV (Thesis)  January 	Residency V (Thesis Defense and Graduation)    BEFORE THE FIRST RESIDENCY      The Writing Life: Writers on How They Think and Work edited by Marie Arana, and two books on the theory of their particular genre (see below):  CREATIVE NONFICTION  Nicole Walker and Margot Singer, eds., Bending Genre  David Lazar, Truth in Nonfiction: Essays    FICTION (including YA)  Stephen King, On Writing  Charles Baxter, Burning Down the House    POETRY  Richard Hugo, Triggering Town Jane Hirschfield, Nine Gates: Entering the Mind of Poetry    WRITING FOR PERFORMANCE   Sam Smiley, Playwriting: The Structure of Action  Lajos Egri, The Art of Dramatic Writing    GRAPHIC NOVEL Will Eisner, Graphic Novel Storytelling and Visual Narrative  Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art  FIRST-RESIDENCY ORIENTATION   New students of the Mile-High MFA program will arrive to their first residency one day early for Orientation, which begins with a Welcome Breakfast at our neighborhood bakery (The Noshery) and is followed by a tour of campus, a review of the program policies & residency expectations, and a two-hour introductory course on their chosen genre.

Art therapy is a special therapeutic approach for working with children, adolescents, their families and/or care providers.  Through art, therapists can work with children who have not developed the cognitive or verbal skills that adults use to discuss feelings, emotions and experiences in therapy. A safe and structured playroom environment is established where children are encouraged to play in ways that reveal concerns, problems and issues they are struggling with.    Art therapy allows:  1.  Children to communicate ideas, feelings and experiences through artistic expression.  2.  Children to recreate and resolve events (such as trauma, divorce, abuse or death of a parent or family member) in art.  3.  Children can rehearse and master life skills and other techniques through art.  4.  Children work through various problems in art.  5.  A window for adults, including parents, caregivers, and foster parents, into a child's world.    A qualified art therapist is able to guide children in ways that are therapeutic and healing. Parents, family members or care providers are often included in the art. This allows the art therapist to observe and interpret the full range of systemic/relational dynamics that are important to the child or adolescent. The art therapist is then able to enter into the intra-psychic and systemic reality of the child resulting in appropriate suggestions/interventions.  The Certificate program also integrates music, play therapy, dance, movement, and other creative approaches. At the School, students will learn to do art therapy with adolescents, adults, couples, and families. Five (5) classes are required for the certificate. The total program cost is $3,000.00.    Courses include:  •   History of Art Therapy  •   Multicultural Art Therapy  •   Family Art Therapy   •   Art Therapy and Play Therapy  •   Art Therapy Practicum     Most classes are available in independent study formats.
