HBI's Pre‐Apprenticeship Certificate Training (PACT) curriculum is one of three pre-apprenticeship curricula approved by the US Department of Labor. PACT is comprised of 4 ""Core"" units (safety, construction math, tools and construction materials, and employability). The curriculum also focuses on one of eight specific trades (i.e. electrical, plumbing, carpentry, etc.).  Students who choose to pursue coursework in Building Construction Technology are exposed to a variety of skills across the trades, including carpentry, electrical wiring, plumbing, masonry, and HVAC, among others.  Upon completion, students earn HBI issued PACT credentials corresponding to the trade area in which they pursued coursework.  Our PACT curriculum is reviewed by subject matter experts from the National Association of Home Builders every two years to ensure training received is up-to-date with current trends in the industry.  Students additionally earn OSHA 10 credentials issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration upon successful program completion.  Texts, workbooks, hard hats, safety glasses and tools are provided for training and job placement.    Following the apprenticeship model, instructors devote 70‐80% of learning to teaching students in the hands‐on skills of construction. The remaining 20‐30% is devoted to classroom instruction and employability skills.     With no more than 12 students under the tutelage of an instructor, students can advance as they master skills. PACT operates on an open‐entry/skilled exit format. Thus, some students will leave the program early making room for additional students.  On average, students complete training within 12-14 weeks.  Upon completion of PACT, participants will be placed in employment, vocational, technical or school based training, apprenticeship or other career progressive track, as appropriate.  HBI's current placement rate is over 85 percent.
